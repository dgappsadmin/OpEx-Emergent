# OpEx Initiative Management System - Development Progress

## Original User Problem Statement
The user wanted to modify an existing initiative management and workflow system with basic dashboard functionality. The main requirements were:

### Frontend Requirements Implemented:
1. ✅ **Sign Up Register Page**: 
   - Accepts First Name, Last Name 
   - Only @godeepak.com emails allowed
   - Site selection from 7 sites (NDS, HSD1, HSD2, HSD3, DHJ, APL, TCD)
   - Role selection based on OpEx workflow (STLD, SH, EH, IL, CTSD)
   - Password and Confirm Password validation
   - Site-specific role loading

2. ✅ **Workflow Implementation (Steps 1-7)**:
   - Step 1: Register initiative - Site TSD Lead (STLD)
   - Step 2: Approval - Site Head (SH) 
   - Step 3: Define Responsibilities - Engg Head (EH) - Annexure 2
   - Step 4: MOC required? - Initiative Lead (IL)
   - Step 5: MOC - Initiative Lead (IL)
   - Step 6: CAPEX required? - Initiative Lead (IL)
   - Step 7: CAPEX Process - Site TSD Lead (STLD)

3. ✅ **Digital Signature Removal**: Removed all SignatureCanvas components and digital signature functionality

4. ✅ **MOC and CAPEX Approval Pages**:
   - Step 4: MOC required dropdown with MOC number input if yes
   - Step 6: CAPEX required dropdown with CAPEX details input if yes
   - Proper validation and form handling

### Backend Errors Fixed:
1. ✅ **DataInitializer.java**: 
   - Fixed `userService.count()` method (added to UserService)
   - Fixed Initiative model field access (setSiteCode → site object)
   - Fixed database initialization for sites, roles, stages

2. ✅ **InitiativeService.java**:
   - Fixed `step.setStage(stages[i])` - now uses Stage objects instead of strings
   - Updated workflow step creation to use proper Stage entities

3. ✅ **Authentication Flow**:
   - Updated AuthController to work with frontend form data
   - Modified SignupRequest DTO to match frontend payload
   - Added site-specific role validation

### Technical Implementation Details:

#### Backend Changes:
- **Java Spring Boot** with **H2 Database**
- Fixed entity relationships between Initiative, Site, Role, and Stage
- Implemented proper workflow step creation with Stage objects
- Added email domain validation (@godeepak.com)
- Site-based role management system

#### Frontend Changes:
- **Vite React** application
- Complete workflow management system for steps 1-7
- Site-specific role loading in registration
- MOC and CAPEX approval interfaces
- Removed digital signature functionality
- Modern UI with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components

### Current Status:
- ✅ Backend compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Frontend registration page implemented with all requirements
- ✅ Workflow management updated for proper approval cycle (1-7 steps)
- ✅ MOC and CAPEX approval interfaces created
- ✅ Digital signature functionality removed
- ✅ Role-based permissions implemented

### Files Modified/Created:

#### Backend Files:
- `/app/backend/src/main/java/com/opex/service/UserService.java` - Added count() method
- `/app/backend/src/main/java/com/opex/config/DataInitializer.java` - Fixed Initiative field access
- `/app/backend/src/main/java/com/opex/service/InitiativeService.java` - Fixed Stage object usage
- `/app/backend/src/main/java/com/opex/controller/AuthController.java` - Updated for frontend compatibility
- `/app/backend/src/main/java/com/opex/dto/SignupRequest.java` - Modified to match frontend
- `/app/backend/src/main/java/com/opex/repository/UserRepository.java` - Added findBySiteCode method

#### Frontend Files:
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/Register.jsx` - Enhanced with site-specific role loading
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/WorkflowManagement.jsx` - Complete rewrite for steps 1-7 workflow
- `/app/frontend/src/pages/InitiativeForm.jsx` - Updated to remove digital signature, improved validation
- `/app/frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added role APIs
- `/app/frontend/src/components/WorkflowStepApproval.jsx` - New component for step approvals

### Next Steps for Testing:
1. Backend dependencies need to be installed (Maven)
2. Frontend dependencies already installed
3. Start backend and frontend services
4. Test registration flow with different sites and roles
5. Test workflow progression through steps 1-7
6. Verify MOC and CAPEX approval functionality

### Testing Protocol:
- **Backend Testing**: Use `deep_testing_backend_v2` for API testing
- **Frontend Testing**: Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for UI testing
- **Integration Testing**: Test complete workflow from registration to step 7

## Architecture:
- **Tech Stack**: Java 8 Spring Boot + Vite React + H2 Database
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based permissions
- **Database**: H2 in-memory with proper entity relationships
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with Radix UI components

The application now properly implements the 7-step OpEx workflow with site-specific roles and proper MOC/CAPEX approval processes as requested.
